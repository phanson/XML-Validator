XML Validator
=============

Have you ever needed to validate an XML file against a schema? Have you tried to find a simple tool that just does validation? I've wanted a tool like this many times in development and, somehow, it doesn't seem to exist! There are many free utilities to perform transformation and other complex operations on XML, but for some reason all the validators cost money.

So this little utility is for everyone else who's been in the same position: a free validator for XML documents that just does what you need.

Requires .NET Framework 4.0.

Usage:

    XmlValidator.exe <schema> <file1> [<file2> ...]
